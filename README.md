## Refactor Code Test
#### This project consists of a basic logging utility. It allows for strings and object messages, of different severity, to be logged to different output systems.


### Setup
Install Node [14](https://nodejs.dev/download) (or 16, [nvm for the win](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

`npm install`

`npm run start`

(./src/main executes)

### Objective
Treat this project like it needs in depth code review or refactor. Go through and make any changes and improvements you see fit. Open an MR against this repository with your changes (or send them over via email).

Be sure to check out package.json to see everything we have setup for you. Also, see ./src/main for example usage of logger (no refactor necessary to ./src/main).

Don't spend too much time on this! We only expect an hour of effort.
